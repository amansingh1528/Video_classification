# Video_classification
# Video Format Converter

This Python script uses FFmpeg to convert a video file from one format to another. It takes an input video file and converts it to the specified output format.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, you need to have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- FFmpeg (a multimedia framework)

You can download FFmpeg from [FFmpeg's official website](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) or install it using a package manager like `apt` or `brew`.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Place the video file you want to convert in the same directory as the script.

3. Modify the `input_file` variable in the script to specify the input video file's path.

4. Open your terminal and run the Python script `video_format_converter.py`.

```bash
python video_format_converter.py
